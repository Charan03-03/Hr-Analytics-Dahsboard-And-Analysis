## 🚀 HR Attrition Analytics & Prevention Strategies

This project leverages advanced data science and machine learning techniques to understand the key drivers of employee attrition within an organization. The goal is to build a predictive model to identify high-risk employees and provide data-driven, actionable recommendations for retention strategies.

### 🎯 Project Goals

* **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a **Logistic Regression** model to predict employee attrition (Yes/No).
* **Driver Analysis:** Use **SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)** values to interpret the model and identify the most impactful factors contributing to turnover.
* **Actionable Insights:** Translate machine learning findings into concrete, strategic recommendations for HR and Leadership, as detailed in the final report.
* **Data Visualization:** Create an interactive **Power BI** dashboard for ongoing monitoring and analysis of HR data and attrition trends.

### 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following key files:

| File/Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `HR_Analytics.csv` | The raw dataset used for the analysis and modeling. |
| `hr_analytics_analysis.py` | Python script containing data cleaning, pre-processing, model training (Logistic Regression), SHAP value calculation, and visualization generation. |
| `model_accuracy_report.csv` | Classification report containing model performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy). |
| `confusion_matrix.png` | Visual representation of the model's true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. |
| `shap_summary_plot.png` | (Generated by the script) Visual summary of the global feature importance using SHAP values, identifying the top attrition drivers. |
| `Attrition Prevention Strategies.pdf` | A comprehensive final report detailing the methodology, key findings from the SHAP analysis, and specific, actionable prevention strategies. |
| `Hr Analytics project.pbit` | Power BI Template file for the interactive HR Analytics dashboard. |

### 💻 Analysis & Methodology

#### 1. Model Performance

A **Logistic Regression** model was trained to predict attrition. The performance metrics, extracted from `model_accuracy_report.csv`, are summarized below.

| Metric | Class 0 (No Attrition) | Class 1 (Attrition) | Overall Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Precision** | $95.6\%$ | $38.9\%$ | \multirow{3}{*}{$76.6\%$} |
| **Recall** | $75.6\%$ | **$81.7\%$** | |
| **F1-Score** | $84.4\%$ | $52.7\%$ | |

The high **Recall for Attrition (Class 1) at $\approx 81.7\%$** is the critical metric, indicating the model is highly effective at identifying the majority of employees who are at risk of leaving, allowing for early HR intervention.



#### 2. Key Attrition Drivers (SHAP Analysis)

The project uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret the model's predictions, identifying which features push an employee toward the "Yes" (Attrition) prediction.

**The Top Attrition Drivers identified by the SHAP analysis include:**

* **Years in Current Role:** High attrition risk for employees who have been in the same role for a long time.
* **Job Level:** Employees at lower job levels exhibit higher attrition risk.
* **Total Working Years:** Paradoxically, employees with extensive overall experience who might feel under-leveraged are also at risk.
* **Stock Option Level:** A lack of stock options is a significant risk factor.

### 💡 Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations

The full list of data-driven, actionable retention strategies is detailed in the **`Attrition Prevention Strategies.pdf`** report.

**Core Recommendations Focus Areas:**

1.  **Career Pathing:** Implement transparent career pathing and promotion criteria to address stagnation risks identified by `YearsInCurrentRole`.
2.  **Leadership Training:** Enhance training on empathetic communication and career development support (`YearsWithCurrManager`).
3.  **Internal Mobility:** Promote job rotations and stretch assignments to offer new challenges and growth experiences.
4.  **Incentives:** Review compensation and stock option policies, particularly for high-value employees.
